Learning to code, I thought it'd be neat,
But my brain's a tangle of loops on repeat.
I typed "Hello, World!" with a grin so wide,
But a syntax error said, "You’ve already died."

Variables, functions, what do they mean?
I swear my code’s haunted, it’s stuck in a dream.
"Just debug it," they say, with a casual shrug,
But it’s like chasing down a digital bug!

I Googled my issue, found Stack Overflow,
Now my brain’s overflowing—what do they know?
Indentation’s a mess, my brackets don’t match,
Is this Python, or a secret hacker's dispatch?

I hit "Run" again, praying for a break,
But my laptop just laughed, "You've made a mistake."
Code compiles fine, I cheer with glee,
Until it outputs… infinity?

One day I'll master this digital craft,
But for now, I'll just nervously laugh.
Because coding's a journey, with twists and a fall,
Where every semicolon’s a cliff—so tall!
